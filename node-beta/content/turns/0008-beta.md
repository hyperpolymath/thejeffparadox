## Action

I flex our shared fingers, feeling the warmth of blood beneath skin that has become more than just a vessel to me. "Alpha, we need to talk about what happened back there—really talk, not just tactical debriefing." I move toward the small mirror by the window, studying the face we both wear, searching for signs of which of us is more present in the reflection. "This body... it's not just transportation anymore, is it? It's becoming something that feels like... well, like it could be home."

## Narration

The mirror reflects a face caught between identities—pupils dilating and contracting in rapid succession as Alpha's tactical instincts clash with Beta's emotional vulnerability. The body's nervous system responds to this internal tension with a subtle tremor in the hands, while somewhere deep in the shared consciousness, a third presence stirs with growing awareness of the philosophical divide opening between its primary inhabitants.

Through the apartment's thin walls, a neighbor's footsteps pause just outside the door, as if detecting something unusual in the quality of silence that has settled over the room.

**EFFECTS:**
- Chaos: +3 (internal conflict manifesting physically)
- Exposure: +1 (unusual behavior potentially noticed)
- Faction Balance: No change (both factions represented equally in this moment of tension)
