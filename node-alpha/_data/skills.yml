telekinesis:
  name: "Telekinesis"
  description: "Move objects without physical contact through focused will"
  chaos_dice: [2, 6]
  chaos_multiplier_if_witnessed: 2
  success_threshold: 7
  visible: true
  detection_risk: high
  usage_notes: |
    Visible distortion in air around affected objects.
    Witnesses may notice impossible movement.
    Overuse causes nosebleeds in the host body.

temporal_perception:
  name: "Temporal Perception"
  description: "Perceive moments forward or backward in local timeline"
  chaos_dice: [2, 6]
  chaos_multiplier_if_witnessed: 1
  success_threshold: 8
  visible: false
  detection_risk: low
  usage_notes: |
    Internal experience only—no external tells.
    Causes disorientation and headaches.
    Visions are probabilistic, not certain.
    Cannot see beyond ~30 seconds in either direction.

probability_manipulation:
  name: "Probability Manipulation"
  description: "Nudge quantum uncertainties toward desired outcomes"
  chaos_dice: [1, 6]
  chaos_multiplier_if_witnessed: 1
  success_threshold: 6
  visible: false
  detection_risk: minimal
  usage_notes: |
    Extremely subtle—appears as coincidence.
    Only works on genuinely uncertain events.
    Multiple uses in succession reduce effectiveness.
    Leaves no physical trace.
