# Governance

## Project Structure

The Jeff Paradox is maintained by the Hyperpolymath collective with
community input.

## Decision Making

### Consensus-Seeking

We aim for consensus on significant changes. If consensus cannot be reached,
maintainers make the final decision with documented rationale.

### Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

Following RSR guidelines:

| Perimeter | Access | Scope |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 🔒 Core | Maintainers | CI/CD, security, releases |
| 🧠 Expert | Trusted contributors | Engine, architecture |
| 🌱 Community | Everyone | Docs, tests, proposals |

## Roles

### Maintainers

- Review and merge pull requests
- Manage releases
- Enforce code of conduct
- Make architectural decisions

### Contributors

- Submit issues and pull requests
- Participate in discussions
- Help with documentation and testing

## Changes to Governance

1. Public proposal (issue or discussion)
2. 14-day comment period
3. Maintainer approval
