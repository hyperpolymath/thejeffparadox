## Overview

**The Jeff Paradox** is an exploration of decision theory, rational choice, and paradoxes in game theory. This project investigates scenarios where rational decision-making leads to seemingly irrational outcomes, providing tools and frameworks for analyzing complex decision scenarios.

## Features

- **Decision Theory Analysis**: Comprehensive frameworks for analyzing rational choice problems
- **Paradox Exploration**: Deep dive into famous decision theory paradoxes
- **Game Theory Models**: Implementation of classic game theory scenarios
- **Interactive Examples**: Hands-on demonstrations of decision-making principles
- **Research Documentation**: Curated collection of decision theory literature and insights

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/thejeffparadox.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd thejeffparadox

# Install dependencies (if applicable)
npm install
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the main analysis
npm start
# or
python main.py

# Explore specific paradoxes
npm run paradox --type=prisoners-dilemma
```
