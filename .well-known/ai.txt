# Additional notes
Notes: |
  The Jeff Paradox is an experiment investigating LLM diachronic identity.
  All dialogue between "Node Alpha" and "Node Beta" is AI-generated.
  The philosophical framing was developed collaboratively between humans and AI.
  No claims are made about AI consciousness or sentience.
  This is an empirical investigation, not a conclusion.

  "The opinions and beliefs expressed do not represent anyone.
  They are the hallucinations of a slab of silicon."
