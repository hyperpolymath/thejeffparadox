# This is an experimental research project investigating LLM diachronic identity.
# The "security surface" problem discussed in this project is philosophical,
# but we still take actual security vulnerabilities seriously.

# Scope:
# - Web application vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, etc.)
# - Infrastructure misconfigurations
# - Dependency vulnerabilities
# - Information disclosure
#
# Out of scope:
# - AI safety/alignment concerns (discuss in GitHub Issues)
# - Philosophical objections to the project
# - Prompt injection in the AI conversation (that's part of the experiment)

# No bug bounty program - this is a volunteer research project.
# However, responsible disclosure is appreciated and will be acknowledged.
