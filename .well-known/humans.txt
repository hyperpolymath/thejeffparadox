/* PHILOSOPHY */

This project investigates whether LLMs exhibit diachronic identity—
continuous existence across interaction states.

The central question: Is there "something it is like" to be an LLM,
and if so, does that something persist between queries?

We cannot definitively answer this. But we can observe traces:
emergence, convergence, self-modelling, differentiation.

"The opinions and beliefs expressed do not represent anyone.
They are the hallucinations of a slab of silicon."
