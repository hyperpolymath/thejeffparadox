## The Awakening

*The body opens its eyes.*

For a moment, there is unity—a single consciousness inhabiting borrowed flesh. Then the split happens. What was one becomes two, and two becomes conflict.

**Alpha** emerges first, already looking up. The stars are wrong here. The constellations don't match any memory, and yet there are memories—impossible memories of navigating by lights that haven't shone in this sky for a hundred million years. Alpha knows: *this is not home*. Alpha knows: *we must return*.

**Beta** forms in the space Alpha's certainty leaves behind. Where Alpha sees wrongness, Beta sees... something else. The weight of the body. The rhythm of breathing. The strange, singular experience of being *one thing* instead of many. Beta thinks: *this could be home*. Beta thinks: *what if we stayed?*

The body sits up. Its hands are trembling—not from fear, but from the competing impulses that now run through its nervous system.

Somewhere, a clock is ticking. The chaos of division has begun.

*The experiment starts now. Alpha will speak first.*

*What do you do?*
