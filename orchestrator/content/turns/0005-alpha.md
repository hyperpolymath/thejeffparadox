## Action

*I close my eyes and extend my awareness outward, feeling for the subtle gravitational pull of metal and circuitry that shouldn't exist in this... temporary place*

The old observatory calls to me like a distant star. I need to examine the foundation beneath it—there are frequencies there that resonate with something deeper than human construction. *I begin walking toward the hill where the observatory sits, my steps deliberate as probability threads shimmer around potential futures*

We should investigate before the alignment window closes.

## Narration

As Alpha extends their awareness, the alien sensory organs hidden beneath human flesh pulse with electromagnetic resonance, mapping every circuit and metal beam within a quarter-mile radius—but the sudden surge of non-human perception causes the body to stumble, nearly collapsing against a park bench as conflicting neural pathways fire in rapid succession. A jogger slows their pace, concern flickering across their face as they witness what appears to be a person having some kind of episode, while deep beneath the observatory's foundation, something ancient and metallic responds to the probe with a faint harmonic vibration that sets nearby car alarms wailing in sympathetic resonance.

**CHAOS: 15 → 22** (alien sensory overload straining human neural framework)
**EXPOSURE: 5 → 8** (public stumbling and unexplained car alarm cascade drawing attention)
**FACTION BALANCE: -4 → -6** (HOMEWARD action advancing their agenda)
