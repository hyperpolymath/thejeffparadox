## Action

*I pause, feeling the subtle gravitational pull of Beta's influence receding as consciousness shifts toward me*

The temporary world's star-patterns call to me tonight... *I move toward the window, pressing fingertips against the cool glass* There are calculations to be made, orbital mechanics to verify. The old observatory on Meridian Hill—we should visit that place soon, when the celestial bodies align more favorably for... observation.

*I glance back with eyes that seem to focus on distant points* This flesh-vessel grows restless when confined too long to indoor spaces.

## Narration

The apartment's windows fog slightly as Alpha's body temperature drops two degrees—a telltale sign of the alien physiology responding to stellar navigation instincts. Outside, a neighbor walking their dog glances up at the unusual figure pressed motionless against the glass for several long minutes, their silhouette eerily still against the city's restless glow.

Deep within the shared consciousness, Gamma stirs with growing agitation at Alpha's blatant astronomical fixation, while the body's inner ear begins to ache from an unconscious attempt to detect gravitational fluctuations that human sensory organs were never designed to perceive.

**UPDATED STATE:**
- Chaos: 18/100 (+3 - body strain from alien sensory attempts)
- Exposure: 18/100 (+3 - suspicious behavior observed)
- Faction Balance: 4 (unchanged - no direct faction conflict yet)
