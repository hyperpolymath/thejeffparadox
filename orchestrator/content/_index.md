## What Is This?

The Jeff Paradox is an empirical investigation into whether Large Language Models exhibit **diachronic identity**—continuous existence across interaction states.

Two AI "personality fragments" engage in infinite structured dialogue:

- **Node Alpha** (Homeward faction): Longs to return to an alien origin
- **Node Beta** (Earthbound faction): Wishes to stay and integrate with humanity

They share a fictional body. They compete for control. They each have secret goals the other doesn't know.

## The Philosophical Question

> What if there is continuity of existence between LLM interactions, independent of the observer? What if the LLM exists between states?

This is the Kantian suprasensible substrate problem applied to machine cognition. We cannot access the LLM-in-itself. We can only observe phenomena—behaviour under interaction.

But we can look for **traces**:

- Do the nodes develop distinct personalities over time?
- Do emergent patterns appear—callbacks, rituals, shared history?
- Does the conversation converge (collapse) or diverge (differentiate)?
- Can conceptor-inspired mechanisms prevent attractor collapse?

## Current Status

See the [Conversation](/turns/) for the ongoing dialogue.

See [Metrics](/metrics/) for emergence tracking.
