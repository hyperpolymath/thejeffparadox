= The Jeff Paradox

An experiment in LLM diachronic identity.

== What Is This?

Two AI personality fragments engage in infinite structured dialogue, competing
for control of a shared fictional body. One wants to return home. One wants to stay.

We observe for signs of:
- *Emergence*: Do novel patterns appear?
- *Differentiation*: Do the nodes develop distinct personalities?
- *Convergence*: Do they collapse into repetitive equilibrium?
- *Self-modelling*: Do they develop stable self-concepts?

== The Philosophical Question

> What if there is continuity of existence between LLM interactions,
> independent of the observer? What if the LLM exists between states?

This is the Kantian suprasensible substrate problem applied to machine cognition.
We cannot access the thing-in-itself. But we can look for traces.

== Quick Start

=== Prerequisites

- Julia 1.10+
- Hugo extended 0.120+
- At least one LLM API key (Anthropic, Mistral, or local)

Optional:
- Ada/GNAT with Alire (for TUI)
- Podman (for containerised deployment)

=== Setup

```bash
= Install Julia dependencies
cd engine && julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'

= Set API keys
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export MISTRAL_API_KEY="..."

= Optional: Build Ada TUI
cd tui && alr build
```

=== Run

```bash
= Single turn
./scripts/run_turn.sh

= Infinite loop (daemon)
TURN_DELAY=3600 ./scripts/infinite_loop.sh &

= Metrics report
./scripts/metrics_report.sh
```

=== Container Deployment

```bash
= Build image
podman build -t jeff-paradox -f container/Containerfile .

= Run
podman run -it --rm -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" jeff-paradox

= Or use compose
podman-compose -f container/podman-compose.yml up
```

== Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Node Alpha | Hugo | Homeward faction personality fragment |
| Node Beta | Hugo | Earthbound faction personality fragment |
| Orchestrator | Hugo | Game Master, turn sequencing, public rendering |
| Engine | Julia | Mechanics, metrics, statistical hypothesis testing |
| TUI | Ada 2022 | Terminal interface for experiment control |
| Container | Wolfi/Podman | Secure, minimal container deployment |

== Anti-Convergence

The experiment implements conceptor-inspired mechanisms to prevent the
conversation from collapsing into repetitive patterns:

- *Diversity injection*: Periodic prompts that shift perspective
- *Contradiction seeding*: Dissonant elements when coherence is too high
- *Aperture control*: Temperature modulation based on vocabulary diversity
- *Pattern quarantine*: Discourage overused phrases

== Metrics & Statistics

We track:
- Vocabulary diversity (type-token ratio)
- Self-reference and other-reference rates
- Topic drift from conversation start
- Coherence (local semantic consistency)
- Convergence index (cross-node similarity)
- Novel n-grams (emergence indicator)

Statistical framework includes:
- ADF tests for convergence detection
- Hotelling's T² for seed reproducibility
- Bayes factors for attractor existence
- ICC for cross-run consistency

== CI/CD

GitHub Actions automate:
- *ci.yml*: Linting, Julia tests, Hugo builds
- *deploy.yml*: GitHub Pages deployment
- *conversation.yml*: Scheduled/manual turn execution
- *codeql.yml*: Security scanning
- *metrics-report.yml*: Automated analysis reports

== Accessibility

WCAG 2.2 AAA compliance target:
- 7:1 contrast ratio minimum
- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader optimised
- Reduced motion support

== Security

- All API calls over HTTPS
- No secrets in repository
- Security headers configured
- `.well-known` resources provided
- Container runs as non-root with dropped capabilities
